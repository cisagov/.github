# Security Policy #

**NOTE: You're almost certainly better off submitting any found vulnerabilities
to the source repository or to the [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)](https://www.cisa.gov/coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure-process).**

Information submitted under this policy will be used for defensive purposes
only â€“ to mitigate or remediate vulnerabilities. If your findings include newly
discovered vulnerabilities that affect all users of a product or service and
not solely these repositories, I may share your report with the Cybersecurity
and Infrastructure Security Agency, where it will be handled under their
coordinated vulnerability disclosure process. We will not share your name or
contact information without express permission.

We accept vulnerability reports via [security@hillaryjeffrey.com](mailto:security@hillaryjeffrey.com). Reports
may be submitted anonymously. If you share contact information, we will
acknowledge receipt of your report within 3 business days.

## What we would like to see from you ##

In order to help us triage and prioritize submissions, we recommend that your
reports:

- Describe the location the vulnerability was discovered and the potential
- impact of exploitation.
- Offer a detailed description of the steps needed to reproduce the
- vulnerability (proof of concept scripts or screenshots are helpful).
- Be in English, if possible.

## What you can expect from us ##

When you choose to share your contact information with us, we commit to
coordinating with you as openly and as quickly as possible.

- Within 3 business days, we will acknowledge that your report has been
  received.
- To the best of our ability, we will confirm the existence of the
  vulnerability to you and be as transparent as possible about what steps we
  are taking during the remediation process, including on issues or challenges
  that may delay resolution.
- We will maintain an open dialogue to discuss issues.

## Questions ##

Questions regarding this policy may be sent to [security@hillaryjeffrey.com](mailto:security@hillaryjeffrey.com).
